# Dengue-Outbreak-Prediction-at-DA-IICT

**Objective:** To predict number of dengue cases for current year from previous yearâ€™s rainfall data and
number of dengue cases

**Description:** Developed a Machine Learning Model using ANN to predict dengue outcome for any desired
day during the year

-Developed a Mathematical Model for Dengue Outcome based on Differential Equations for finding the
total number of cases during the desired timeframe

-Built an Android app giving Danger Index(DI) for the day using various parameters and indicating
precautions based on the severity of the DI
The project was selected for incubation at IIPH.

**Personal Contribution:** Made the ML model
